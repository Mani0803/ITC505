        <h1>Virtual Services in the Health Sciences</h1> <!-- Changed to h1 -->

        <p>Virtual services have been part of health sciences libraries for a long time in various forms, including the provision of reference and research services via email or chat, availability of online instruction, access to electronic materials, and the curation of virtual research guides. But when the COVID-19 pandemic forced many libraries to close their doors and pivot to virtual services almost overnight. Moving all services remote, even for just a short time, did highlight what worked well and what did not. The situation increased visibility of these services and made patrons more aware of what was available, perhaps making them more likely to expect and use those services in the future. In some ways, the pandemic showed us ways in which virtual services could even be better than in-person services for providing prompt patron services. The situation increased visibility of existing services, making users more aware of what was available, and revealed gaps and needed improvements in virtual services.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In this book copublished by the Medical Library Association, librarians from academic to hospital health sciences libraries, from rural to urban areas, and across a range of service specialties provide blueprints and best practices for building and maintaining sustainable virtual services in health sciences libraries. Each chapter in this volume addresses aspects of providing virtual services in information and access services, reference and instruction, collections, and clinical services written by contributors who have been involved in this work in their own libraries.</p>

        <p>Whether you are just beginning an implementation, assessing and refining current offerings, or strategizing for sustainability and looking to the future, this book will provide practical advice, tools, and considerations for maximizing user engagement and satisfaction with virtual library services and resources.</p>

                <h2>Addendum: CSS Styling Choices</h2>
            
                <p><strong>Font Choices:</strong> Arial and sans-serif fonts were selected for their readability and compatibility across various devices and platforms. These fonts ensure that the content remains easily accessible and legible for all users.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Heading and Text Sizes:</strong> The headings are centered and styled with larger font sizes (h1: 28px, h2: 24px) to emphasize their importance and hierarchy. Paragraph text, on the other hand, is styled with a slightly smaller font size (16px) to maintain a balance between readability and visual appeal.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Colors:</strong> The color scheme was carefully chosen to create a professional and harmonious appearance. Shades of black and gray (#333 and #555) were used for headings and paragraph text to ensure good contrast against the white background (#fff), enhancing readability.</p>

                <p><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Attention was given to ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background elements to meet accessibility standards. Contrast ratios were checked using online tools to ensure that text remains easily readable for users with visual impairments or color deficiencies.</p>

                <p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The CSS styles were designed with responsiveness in mind, utilizing media queries to adapt the layout and typography for various screen sizes and devices. This approach ensures that the content remains accessible and visually appealing across desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>

                <p><strong>Line Spacing:</strong> To further improve readability, the line-height property was adjusted to 1.6, providing ample spacing between lines of text. This spacing enhances legibility, especially for longer paragraphs, by preventing lines from appearing crowded or overlapping.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Padding and Margins:</strong> Each paragraph is given 15px padding and 8px bottom margin to provide sufficient spacing between the content elements. This spacing not only improves readability but also creates a visually pleasing layout.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Background Colors:</strong> To add visual interest and delineate content sections, each paragraph's padding has been assigned a unique background color. Colors such as Light Pink (#ffb6c1), Light Sky Blue (#87cefa), Light Green (#90ee90), Gold (#ffd700), and Coral (#ff7f50) were chosen to create a vibrant yet cohesive look.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Border Radius and Box Shadow:</strong> A border-radius of 8px was applied to the paragraphs to create a subtle rounded edge effect, adding a touch of sophistication to the design. Additionally, a slight box shadow was included to provide depth and separation from the background, enhancing the overall visual appeal.</p>

                <p><strong>Accessibility Considerations:</strong> Accessibility features such as focus outlines and aria-label attributes were included to ensure that the webpage is accessible to users with disabilities. These features improve keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility, making the content more inclusive and usable for all users.</p>

                <h3>HTML Element Choices:</h3>
                <p>The <strong>h1</strong> tag was chosen for the main heading of the webpage to signify its importance as the primary title. Similarly, the <strong>h2</strong> tag was used for subheadings and section titles, providing hierarchy and structure to the content. Lastly, the <strong>footer</strong> element was utilized to contain metadata and copyright information, logically separating it from the main content.</p>
                
                <h3>Footer:</h3>
                <p>The footer section was added to provide essential metadata about the webpage, including the last updated date. This information enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the content, reassuring users that they are accessing the most recent version of the webpage. Additionally, the footer script dynamically updates the last modified date, ensuring accuracy and relevance.</p>

            <h2>HTML abuse</h2>
            <p>During the initial development, I made some choices in the HTML structure based on visual appearance rather than semantic hierarchy. One such instance was using an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the title of the essay in the header. Although this decision might have been influenced by the desire for a specific font size, it doesn't accurately represent the semantic structure of the page.</p>
            <p>As part of the project's refinement, I've corrected this by replacing the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag with the more appropriate <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag for the main title.</p>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>

</body>
</html>
